# Alan-Todo-Template

Create an android application and add smart voice assistant with Alan AI in just a few steps.

### Step 1: Fork this repository
Forking the repository will create a copy of the repository in your gitHub where you can add custom features and build a different version of the app for yourself. You can also, contribute to the template by suggesting necessary changes through issues.

### Step 2: Clone your repository
After forking the repository head over to your copy and fork clone the repository in your local system. Open the project with Android Studio. Your JDK version might mismatch, so select "Use Embedded JDK" when prompted in android studio.

### Step 3: Sign Up to Alan Studio
After the build is successful, sign up to Alan Studio and create a project to get the API key. Alan provides APIs for our android application to enable voice assistant. Paste the API key in your project and run the application.

### Step 4: Add custom code
Once your application is built successfully and runs on your emulator/mobile, you can add more functionality in the app and make your own version of it. Search for "Todo" in the project to add code to interact with Alan. For more detailed steps on how to add Alan and work with advanced functionalities, refer to my blog.

If you find any bugs in the template or want to suggest new code for beginners to get started, feel free to create a new issue. You'll be requested for a PR if your issue is valid for the template and merged if it meets the requirement.
